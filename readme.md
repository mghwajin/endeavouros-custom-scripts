# Endeavour OS custom scripts
This repo is a collection of basic scripts I've created, either as general tools or workarounds to issues. Nothing fancy. They're a way of compiling solutions I've seen posted across various threads into something that works for my system.

The collection will grow slowly as I slowly trundle through my novice user experience.

Current contents:
- [xfce4-screenshooter-autosave](scripts/xfce4-screenshooter-autosave) - Automatically save a fullscreen screenshot with the date appended to the filename. Bypasses the window waiting for filename input from user. Useful keyboard shortcut.


> [!NOTE]
> For fellow beginners, these scripts may require you to edit them slightly to match your setup. Example: If `/home/some-user` is referenced in a command, it should be edited to match your `/home/user` directory.
>
> **Make sure to set the file as executable!**
